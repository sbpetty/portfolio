        <!-- My name is Benjamin Petty, and I'm a freshman at BYU-I studying computer science.
        I have a fair amount of experience coding in multiple languages, including C++, Python, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL, but I plan for my knowledge pool to only grow.
        In my free time, I love to play and sing music with people, read books, and spend way too much time and energy organizing random things.
        ChatGPT's version: -->
        Hello, I'm Benjamin Petty, currently a freshman at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I am a degree in computer science. 
        My journey into the world of programming began at a young age, and over the years, I have acquired a substantial breadth of 
        experience across a multitude of programming languages. My proficiency spans languages such as C++, Python, HTML, JavaScript, 
        and SQL, reflecting a strong foundation in both high-level and web development languages.
        While my programming skills continue to evolve, I have unwavering enthusiasm for expanding my knowledge and technical capabilities. 
        My educational pursuit in computer science is not merely an academic endeavor but a lifelong commitment to keeping pace with the 
        ever-evolving tech landscape. I am excited about embracing emerging technologies, mastering new programming languages, and 
        contributing to innovative solutions in the digital world.
        Beyond the realm of coding, I am equally passionate about the world of music. I find joy in creating music and sharing it with 
        others. Whether it's playing a musical instrument or lending my voice through singing, I believe that music has the power to 
        connect people on a profound level. It provides an escape from the stresses of life and offers a platform for self-expression 
        and shared experiences.
        I also enjoy reading and possess a strong appreciation for books. Reading is a favorite pastime that allows me to explore 
        different worlds, stimulate my imagination, and gain a deeper understanding of various perspectives.
        Moreover, I've always had a knack for organization. I invest a significant amount of my free time and energy in bringing order 
        to chaos, be it in my personal space, digital files, or daily routines. This meticulous approach to organization not only 
        enhances productivity but also reflects my commitment to efficiency and excellence in all aspects of life.
        As I embark on my academic and personal journey, my vision is to seamlessly integrate my technical prowess, musical passions, 
        literary interests, and organizational skills. These elements collectively define my path forward, and I invite you to explore my 
        website to learn more about the projects and experiences that are shaping my future. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward 
        to sharing more of my journey with you.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- I am the 8th of 10 siblings. I was born and raised in North Carolina, and homeschooled K-12.
        I've been coding since I was about 10 years old. I started with a JavaScript course on KhanAcademy, and ever since then I was hooked. When I was 13,
        I coded my own simple game on KhanAcademy with JavaScript and KhanAcademy's built-in library.
        Later on, I took classes from various sources in both Python and C++, as well as learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and SQL.
        I plan to grow my skills in lower-level languages such as C and C++ and specialize as a back-end software developer, 
        but I'm also interested in game development and cybersecurity.
        I've also been playing the piano since I was about 6 and enjoying it thoroughly, along with singing and playing any instrument I can get my hands on.
        I have performed at multiple recitals, talent shows, and in my church.
        I have a strong passion for music, and plan for it to continue to be a big part of my life.
        I've had multiple part-time jobs in the past such as working at a grocery store and as a custodian, 
        which have grown my skills of teamwork, communication, and leadership.
        I have also served in multiple leadership positions in my local church, including class presidencies in my youth group.
        I participated in the Boy Scouts of America program, and served in multiple leadership positions within my troop. I earned the Life Scout rank.
        Most people who know me would describe me as friendly and easy to get along with, yet highly analytical, logical, and organized.
        I love working on teams, connecting with and getting to know people.
        One of my biggest goals in life is to become a husband and father. I want to find a career that will allow me to support my future children.
        ChatGPT's version: -->
        I am the eighth child in a family of ten, and my the entirety of my childhood years were spent in North Carolina, where I received K-12 homeschooling. 
        This early educational experience instilled in me values such as independence and self-discipline, which have had a lasting impact on my personal and 
        professional development.
        My interest in technology and programming was piqued at an early age, around ten, when I embarked on a JavaScript course on Khan Academy. 
        I vividly recall creating my first JavaScript game on Khan Academy at the age of 13, using the platform's built-in library. This marked the 
        beginning of my journey into the world of coding. Over the years, I broadened my horizons by delving into Python and C++, as well as gaining 
        proficiency in HTML, CSS, and SQL.
        My career aspirations in technology encompass several facets. While I am committed to honing my skills in lower-level languages like C and C++ 
        to specialize as a back-end software developer, I am also deeply interested in game development and cybersecurity. These pursuits reflect my 
        ambition to have a well-rounded and versatile career in the tech industry.
        In addition to my technological interests, I am passionate about music. I began learning the piano at the age of six and have enjoyed playing 
        various musical instruments, as well as singing. My love for music has translated into performances at recitals, talent shows, and in the setting 
        of my local church. Music is not just a pastime for me; it's an integral part of my identity, and I am dedicated to its continued presence in my life.
        Beyond my technical and musical pursuits, I have actively sought opportunities for personal and professional growth. This has included various 
        part-time jobs, such as working at a grocery store and as a custodian. These experiences have strengthened my teamwork, communication, and 
        leadership skills.
        In terms of leadership, I have served in various capacities within my local church, including holding class presidencies in my youth group. 
        My involvement in the Boy Scouts of America program allowed me to take on leadership roles within my troop, culminating in achieving the rank 
        of Life Scout. These experiences have not only shaped my character but also equipped me with essential leadership, organizational, and 
        communication skills.
        Colleagues and acquaintances often describe me as affable and easy to work with. However, underlying my friendly demeanor is a highly analytical, 
        logical, and organized mindset. I love to solve problems and learn to see concepts in different ways, but I also thrive in collaborative 
        environments and value the opportunity to connect with and understand people on a deeper level.
        In summary, my life has been marked by a diverse range of experiences, interests, and aspirations. From coding to music, leadership roles to 
        personal growth, my journey continues to unfold with abundant opportunities and a resolute commitment to excellence. Explore my personal website
        to learn more about my endeavors and connect with me as I progress through this exciting journey. Thank you for joining me on this path!
