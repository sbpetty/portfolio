                I am the eighth child in a family of ten, and my the entirety of my childhood years were spent in North Carolina, where I received K-12 homeschooling. 
                This early educational experience instilled in me values such as independence and self-discipline, which have had a lasting impact on my personal and 
                professional development.
            <br>
                My interest in technology and programming was piqued at an early age, around ten, when I embarked on a JavaScript course on Khan Academy. 
                I vividly recall creating my first JavaScript game on Khan Academy at the age of 13, using the platform's built-in library. This marked the 
                beginning of my journey into the world of coding. Over the years, I broadened my horizons by delving into Python and C++, as well as gaining 
                proficiency in HTML, CSS, and SQL.
            <br>
                My career aspirations in technology encompass several facets. While I am committed to honing my skills in lower-level languages like C and C++ 
                to specialize as a back-end software developer, I am also deeply interested in game development and cybersecurity. These pursuits reflect my 
                ambition to have a well-rounded and versatile career in the tech industry.
            <br>
                In addition to my technological interests, I am passionate about music. I began learning the piano at the age of six and have enjoyed playing 
                various musical instruments, as well as singing. My love for music has translated into performances at recitals, talent shows, and in the setting 
                of my local church. Music is not just a pastime for me; it's an integral part of my identity, and I am dedicated to its continued presence in my life.
            <br>
                Beyond my technical and musical pursuits, I have actively sought opportunities for personal and professional growth. This has included various 
                part-time jobs, such as working at a grocery store and as a custodian. These experiences have strengthened my teamwork, communication, and 
                leadership skills.
            <br>
                In terms of leadership, I have served in various capacities within my local church, including holding class presidencies in my youth group. 
                My involvement in the Boy Scouts of America program allowed me to take on leadership roles within my troop, culminating in achieving the rank 
                of Life Scout. These experiences have not only shaped my character but also equipped me with essential leadership, organizational, and 
                communication skills.
            <br>
                Colleagues and acquaintances often describe me as affable and easy to work with. However, underlying my friendly demeanor is a highly analytical, 
                logical, and organized mindset. I love to solve problems and learn to see concepts in different ways, but I also thrive in collaborative 
                environments and value the opportunity to connect with and understand people on a deeper level.
            <br>   
                In summary, my life has been marked by a diverse range of experiences, interests, and aspirations. From coding to music, leadership roles to 
                personal growth, my journey continues to unfold with abundant opportunities and a resolute commitment to excellence. Explore my personal website
